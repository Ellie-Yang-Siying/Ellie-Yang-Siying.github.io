Classified advertisement platforms, such as Avito, serve as crucial facilitators of online commerce,
connecting millions of users daily. This project aims to predict the likelihood of a successful deal by
leveraging multi-modal data from Avitoâ€™s dataset, which includes tabular, text, and image data. Using
machine learning models such as LightGBM and ensemble techniques, we explored the integration of
diverse data modalities to improve predictive accuracy. Advanced feature engineering, including
embeddings from NLP models like FastText, SpaCy, and TFI-DF, and image embeddings from ResNet50,
combined with techniques such as stacking and Bayesian hyperparameter tuning, demonstrated the
complementary power of different data types. The best-performing model, which integrated tabular, text
embeddings, and image embeddings, demonstrated a significant improvement in predictive accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging multi-modal data for demand prediction in dynamic online
marketplaces.
