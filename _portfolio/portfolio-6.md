title: "Stock Performance Analysis and Prediction"
excerpt: >
  We utilized Tableau and Python as tools to analyze and compare the stocks of two gaming companies, ATVI and EA. Our analysis involved various data exploration and visualization techniques, followed by the application of multiple models to fit and predict stock prices. Ultimately, we identified the characteristics of both stocks, compared their investment potential, and provided a recommendation, presenting our findings in a comprehensive report.
