title: "Wind-Speed-and-Wind-Power-Visualization-and-Prediction"
excerpt: >
 As wind power plays an increasingly significant role in the energy structure, wind power prediction has become a prominent research topic. Accurate wind power forecasting can effectively guide peak shaving and energy storage management, promoting the utilization and development of wind energy. This study focuses on a given wind farm dataset, first conducting an exploratory analysis of the data and then employing both deep learning and statistical methods for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. The primary focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of different neural network architectures in deep learning-based wind power prediction, providing deeper insights into the crucial role of big data and artificial intelligence in the energy and power sector.
